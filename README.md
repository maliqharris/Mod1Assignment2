# Assignment 2!
## This is the greatest piece of code ever derived by man.
**Simply input two numbers when asked and the code will find
the sum, difference, product, and quotient of those two numbers! Amazing!**
>If for some reason the second number is a zero the code will not give you
a quotient and simply tell you that it cannot divide by zero!  _fantastic!_
