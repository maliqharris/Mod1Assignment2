    "### **Assignment 02: Basic Arithmetic with Two Numbers**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Overview**\n",
    "Create a Python program that prompts the user to enter two numbers and then performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on them. The program should display the results in a clear, user-friendly manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Objectives**\n",
    "- Get comfortable with user input and data type conversion.  \n",
    "- Practice basic arithmetic operations in Python.  \n",
    "- Learn how to handle edge cases (e.g., division by zero).  \n",
    "- Format and present output neatly.\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Detailed Instructions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt the User for Two Numbers**  \n",
    "   - Use the `input()` function twice to ask the user for two numeric values.  \n",
    "   - Convert these input strings to a numeric type (e.g., `float` or `int`).  \n",
    "   - Example prompt:  \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Pseudocode\n",
    "     first_num = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n",
    "     second_num = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Perform Arithmetic Operations**  \n",
    "   - **Addition**: Add the two numbers and store the result.  \n",
    "   - **Subtraction**: Subtract the second number from the first and store the result.  \n",
    "   - **Multiplication**: Multiply the two numbers and store the result.  \n",
    "   - **Division**: Check if the second number is zero before dividing. If it is zero, handle the scenario by printing a message (e.g., “Cannot divide by zero!”).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output the Results**  \n",
    "   - Print each operation's result to the screen.  \n",
    "   - Clearly label each operation so the user knows which result corresponds to which calculation.  \n",
    "   - Consider formatting floating-point results to two decimal places (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Test Your Program**  \n",
    "   - Try several different test cases:\n",
    "     - **Positive numbers** (e.g., 10 and 3).  \n",
    "     - **Zero** values (especially as the second input for division).  \n",
    "     - **Negative numbers** (e.g., -5 and 2).  \n",
    "     - **Decimal/float inputs** (e.g., 3.5 and 1.25).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Submit Your Work**  \n",
    "   - Push your code to a GitHub repository named something like `basic-arithmetic-assignment`.  \n",
    "   - Include a `README.md` that briefly explains what your code does and how to run it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Tips & Tricks**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Division by Zero**:  \n",
    "  Always check if the second number is zero. If it is, handle it gracefully to avoid crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Input Validation** (optional):  \n",
    "  Use a `try-except` block to catch errors if someone enters invalid data (like letters).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Formatting Output**:  \n",
    "  To make your output more readable, you can use Python’s formatting features:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  print(f\"Sum: {sum_result:.2f}\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add Comments**:  \n",
    "  Make sure to include inline comments explaining each major step or variable in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Have Fun**:  \n",
    "  Consider adding extra operations like exponentiation, modulo (`%`), or floor division (`//`), as long as it doesn’t complicate the basic requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Grading Criteria**  \n",
    "1. **Correctness**: Does the code perform the requested operations accurately?  \n",
    "2. **Error Handling**: Does it handle division by zero gracefully?  \n",
    "3. **Readability**: Are there clear comments, descriptive variable names, and logical organization?  \n",
    "4. **GitHub Submission**: Is the repository organized (with a `README.md`) and code properly committed?\n",
